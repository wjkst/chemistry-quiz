a small basic chemistry quiz for chemistry students who need to learn a thing or two. it is still in Dutch but WIP to get it to English. 

to add your own open questions do it like this:

**('question', ['answer'], 'answer')**

to add your own multiple choice questions do it like this: 

**('question', [ 'option 1', ' option 2', 'option 3'], 'correct option')**

the programme will go through the 3 categories systematically but the questions in the categories will be counted in random order.
